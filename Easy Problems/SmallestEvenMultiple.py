'''
Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.

Example 2:
Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.
 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 150
